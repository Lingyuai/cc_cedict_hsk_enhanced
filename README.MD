# Use

- Convert u8 cxdict files to csv using `cxdict_to_csv.py`.
- Merge csv files using `hsk_files_merger.py`.

By default, all paths are already passed to the called scripts, but you can override these paths at your own will.

`hsk_file_prefixer.py` is intended to merge a list of .tsv/.csv files to a single .csv file.

Orignal files can be found in the `original` folder.
Merged files can be found in the `revised` folder.
The file with all merged content is called `merged_hanzi_data.csv` in the `revised` folder.
